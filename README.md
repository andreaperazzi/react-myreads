#MyReads: A Book Lending App

This project was built for the Udacity [React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

## How to Load the App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the app and clone it.

```
git clone https://github.com/andreaperazzi/react-myreads.git

```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with. `npm start` or  `yarn start`. A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.


## Backend Server
To simplify your development Udacity, provided a backend server and the file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needs to perform necessary operations on the backend.


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
